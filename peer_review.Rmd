### Note to Reader
The group we were assigned to review did not submit a project draft and only had their proposal uploaded. As a result, we will evaluate each of the three data sets and research questions they recommended in their project proposal. Therefore, the only categories we could evaluate them on was "Introduction and Data" as well as "Final Considerations."

### Peer Feedback 
#### Introduction and Data
Is the research question and goal of the report clearly stated?
Does the introduction provide appropriate background context and motivation for a general reader?
Is the source of the data stated with an appropriate citation?
Is it clear when and how the data was collected?
Is data manipulation described clearly (missing data, creation of new variables, etc)?
Are the cases and relevant variables described?

Dataset 1: 
a) The authors clearly state their research question for this dataset. They should also include a null and alternate hypothesis rather than simply including their prediction.
b) Since this is only a proposal, the authors are missing their motivation/ background to studying the topic
c) The proposal did include references to the dataset, but did not properly cite with MLA or APA 
d) The authors did indicate that their data was collected through webscraping the "Encyclopedia Titanica" website, but did not indicate when the data was collected
e) The group does not specify if they manipulated any variables and did not address missing data
f) The authors state relevant variables, but don't describe them in detail. 

Dataset 2: 
a) Two research questions are provided, along with a null and alternate hypothesis. When writing their project draft, the team should decide which they want to study.  
b) Authors have done a good job in describing the background information about their dataset and why their study will be important.
c) Source of data is included in a link, and should be cited using the proper format if necessary.
d) The authors do not include how and when the data was collected and would be a good idea if they mention that in their project draft.
e) Since the group has not yet completed the methodology section of their report, they have not yet manipulated the chosen dataset.
f) The cases and relevant variables should be described in an in-depth manner so that the readers of the report can understand their calculations, visualizations, and conclusions better.

Dataset 3:
a) Two research questions are provided, along with null and alternative hypothesis. When writing their project draft, the team should decide which they want to study. 
b) Authors have done a good job in describing the background information about their dataset -- the need to statistically predict players' success in NBA -- and why their study will be important for the basketball industry.
c) Source of data is included in a link, and should be cited using the proper format (APA or MLA) if necessary.
d) The authors do not include how and when the data was collected and would be a good idea if they mention that in their project draft.
e) Since the group has not yet completed the methodology section of their report, they have not yet manipulated the chosen dataset.
f) The case is well explained and the two research variable -- point per game & position of player -- are self-explanatory to audiences. If necessary, the author may want to explain the five different position in basketball a bit: what are they and how are they different.

#### Final Considerations
What is one question you have for the group after reading their analysis?
What is one thing the group has done especially well?

Dataset 1:
a) Isn't this dataset the same as Lecture Notes #21 Logistic Regression? You should avoid using dataset covered in the class as part of the final project requirement.
b) The author does a good job selecting proper variable -- passenger class -- that may be have actual cause-and-effect relationship with the response variabel -- passenger survival rate. 

Dataset 2:
a) How do you want to study the relationship between two dummy explanatory variable and one dummy response variable? What visualization technique do you want to employ?
b) They've chosen an especially relevant topic -- police killing. The could yield interesting results if anlayzed well.

Dataset 3:
a) How do you measure success in NBA? Which variable in the dataset represent it?
b) The two research questions are easy to be analyzed and the explanatory variables makes sense in real world -- points-per-game and positions can be important for basketball player's success.

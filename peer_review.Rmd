### Note to Reader
The group we were assigned to review did not submit a project draft and only had their proposal uploaded. As a result, we will evaluate each of the three datasets and research questions they recommended in their project proposal. The only categories we could evaluate them on was "Introduction and Data" as well as "Final Considerations."

### Peer Feedback 
#### Introduction and Data
Is the research question and goal of the report clearly stated?
Does the introduction provide appropriate background context and motivation for a general reader?
Is the source of the data stated with an appropriate citation?
Is it clear when and how the data was collected?
Is data manipulation described clearly (missing data, creation of new variables, etc)?
Are the cases and relevant variables described?

Dataset 1: 
a) The authors clearly state their research question for this dataset
b) Since this is only a proposal, the authors are missing their motivation/ background to studying the topic
c) The proposal did include references to the dataset, but did not properly cite with MLA or APA 
d) The authors did indicate that their data was collected through webscraping the "Encyclopedia Titanica" website, but did not indicate when the data was collected
e) The group does not specify if they manipulated any variables and did not address missing data
f) The authors state relevant variables, but don't describe them in detail. 

Dataset 2: 
a) 
b)
c)
d)
